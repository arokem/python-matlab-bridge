# Python-MATLAB(R) Bridge and ipython matlab_magic

A python interface to call out to [Matlab(R)](http://mathworks.com). Original
implementation by [Max Jaderberg](http://www.maxjaderberg.com/)

This implementation also includes an [ipython](http://ipython.org) matlab_magic
extension, which provides a much simplified interface for weaving python and
Matlab code together.  


***AT PRESENT THIS MAY NOT WORK ON WINDOWS; BETA TESTERS WANTED ***

## Usage

For examples, check out the `.ipynb` files

## Installation

todo

### API: 

Initialize the Matlab class:

    from pymatbridge import Matlab
    mlab = Matlab()

By default the matlab executable is whatever gets called when you type 'matlab'
in your terminal, the host is localhost and the port is a random unused port.

You can specify these in the following manner: 

    mlab = Matlab(matlab='/Applications/MATLAB_R2011a.app/bin/matlab',
                    host='192.168.0.1', port=5151)

You must then start the MATLAB server:

    mlab.start()

which will return True once connected.

You can then run any local MATLAB function contained within a .m file of the
same name. For example, to call the function jk in jk.m:

    %% MATLAB
    function lol = jk(args)
        arg1 = args.arg1;
        arg2 = args.arg2;
        lol = arg1 + arg2;
    end

by calling:

    res = mlab.run_func('path/to/jk.m', {'arg1': 3, 'arg2': 5})
    print res['result']

which will print 8.

Or you can run some arbitrary matlab code:

    res = mlab.run_code('a=10; b=a+3')

You can shut down the MATLAB server by calling

    mlab.stop()

NB: you can call MATLAB code before the server starts by adding code to the ./matlab/startup.m file.


### Matlab magic: 

This can be used in an ipython session in the following manner:

    import pymatbridge as pymat
    ip = get_ipython()
    pymat.load_ipython_extension(ip)

These lines will automatically start the matlab session for you. Then, you can
simply decorate a line/cell with the '%matlab' or '%%matlab' decorator and
write matlab code:

    %%matlab 
    a = linspace(0.01,6*pi,100);
    plot(sin(a))
    grid on
    hold on
    plot(cos(a),'r')

### Warnings

Python communicates with Matlab via an ad-hoc webserver. This is inherently
insecure, as the Matlab instance may be directed to perform arbitrary system
calls. There is no sandboxing of any kind. Use this code at your own risk.

# Examples

An example MATLAB function and usage from Python is shown in test.py and test.m
and there. Example notebooks are in the '.ipynb' files.
