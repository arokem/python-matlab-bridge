pymatbridge_zmq v1.0

How to use:
1. Go to /src and "make". This will generate the mex file and move it to /matlab. 
2. Use the Ipython notebook to see the example

This work is incomplete. The current version only supports session start, stop and 
running function. In the future all the system files would be moved to /util. All 
user scripts will be stored under /usrprog.
